Liar and scoundrel you are, in every action of your life; theft is your trade; and double dastard you must be, or you were not here today. Hard words will not move me, nor would hard blows. Here I stand, and will, till I have done my errand.’</p><p>‘Girl!’ said Ralph, ‘retire! We can use force to him, but I would not hurt you if I could help it. Retire, you weak and silly wench, and leave this dog to be dealt with as he deserves.’</p><p>‘I will not retire,’ cried Kate, with flashing eyes and the red blood mantling in her cheeks. ‘You will do him no hurt that he will not repay. You may use force with me; I think you will, for I <em>am</em> a girl, and that would well become you. But if I have a girl’s weakness, I have a woman’s heart, and it is not you who in a cause like this can turn that from its purpose.’</p></div> </div>
