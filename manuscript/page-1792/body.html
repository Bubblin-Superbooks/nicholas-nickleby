<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">bed, and all the post-obits fell in. I’ll be married in the bottle-green. Peg. Peg Sliderskew—I’ll wear the bottle-green!’</p><p>This call, loudly repeated twice or thrice at the room-door, brought into the apartment a short, thin, weasen, blear-eyed old woman, palsy-stricken and hideously ugly, who, wiping her shrivelled face upon her dirty apron, inquired, in that subdued tone in which deaf people commonly speak:</p><p>‘Was that you a calling, or only the clock a striking? My hearing gets so bad, I never know which is which; but when I hear a noise, I know it must be one of you, because nothing else never stirs in the house.’</p><p>‘Me, Peg, me,’ said Arthur Gride, tapping himself on the breast to render the reply more intelligible.</p><p>‘You, eh?’ returned Peg. ‘And what do <em>you</em> want?’</p><p>‘I’ll be married in the bottle-green,’ cried Arthur Gride.</p></div> </div>
