If it comes at all, it will be here by the two o’clock delivery. I shall leave the city about that time and walk to Charing Cross on the left-hand side of the way; if there are any letters, come and meet me, and bring them with you.’</p><p>Noggs nodded; and as he nodded, there came a ring at the office bell. The master looked up from his papers, and the clerk calmly remained in a stationary position.</p><p>‘The bell,’ said Noggs, as though in explanation. ‘At home?’</p><p>‘Yes.’</p><p>‘To anybody?’</p><p>‘Yes.’</p></div> </div>
