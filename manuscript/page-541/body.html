Actuated by no personal motives, but moved only by high and great constitutional considerations; which I will not attempt to explain, for they are really beneath the comprehension of those who have not made themselves masters, as I have, of the intricate and arduous study of politics; I would rather keep my seat, and intend doing so.</p><p>‘Will you do me the favour to present my compliments to the constituent body, and acquaint them with this circumstance?</p><p>‘With great esteem, ‘My dear Mr. Pugstyles, ‘&c.&c.’</p></div> </div>
